In the following address: https://www.monterrey.cinvestav.mx/msantillan/Coronavirus, you can find a blog with an analysis of the trends of daily hospital admission incidences (according to the date of symptoms onset). An essential part ot this analysis is the nowcating of recent hospital admission incidences, which is aimed at correcting the undersestimation due to the delay between symptoms onset and confirmation of a given case. The employed methodology is described in detail in the above referred blog. The files in this repository contain the results of the nowcating analysis. They are updated daily.
